1. Create a repo and clone it in local 
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (It will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initialization of DVC
4. pip install dvc
5. Now wo do initiate dvc "dvc init" (and create .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new directory S3)
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
